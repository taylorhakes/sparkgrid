# Things that need to be converted to vanilla JS

### Examples
- example 6 (Remote Model): Need to find a new JSONp example and move RemoteModel.js to another location
- example 9 (Row Reordering): Need to create a generic interface for drag and drop, so any library can be used

### Bundling
- Need to convert to ES6 Module syntax and have multiple bundling options, not just all or nothing
